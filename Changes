0.01  Fri Apr 21 05:45:54 2006
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X -b 5.6.0 -n Geo::ReadGRIB

0.40  Sat May27

        - Added a tempfile() method based on File::Tmp to name
          temp filed so had to change perl version to "use 5.6.1"
        - Each method that uses wgrib.exe now uses tempfile() to
          name temp files and then removes them when done. 
	- Changed tests to use full path to test GRIB file
	- POD doc tweaks

        - New method extractLaLo() extracts forecast data for a given
          type and time for a range of locations. The locations will be
          all (lat, long) points in the GRIB file inside the rectangular
          area defined by (lat1, long1) and (lat2, long2) where lat1
          >= lat2 and long1 <= long2.  - that is, lat1 is north or lat2
          and long1 is west of long2 (or the same as...)
