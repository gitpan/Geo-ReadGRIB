Geo-ReadGRIB
============

Geo::ReadGRIB is an Perl module that provides read access to data 
distributed in GRIB files. Specifically, I wrote it to access NOAA Wavewatch 
III marine weather model forecasts. As of version 0.98_1 Geo::ReadGRIB is known to 
support Canadian Meteorological Center's GEM model GRIB files. It may support
many other GRIB variants which use a rectangular lat/long grid but they have not 
been tested. Please notify the maintainers and let them know if it does or doesn't 
support your files.

wgrib.c

Geo::ReadGRIB uses the C program wgrib to retrieve the GRIB file catalog and 
to extract the data. wgrib.c is included in the distribution and will compile 
when you make the module. The resulting executable is named wgrib.exe and 
should install in the same location as ReadGRIB.pm. ReadGRIB.pm will search 
for wgrib.exe at run time and die if it can't find it.

wgrib.c is known to compile and install correctly with Geo::ReadGRIB on 
all common platforms. See the CPAN Testers reports for this module for details.


I've also been able to compile wgrib.c with gcc on Solaris Sparc and i386.
