Geo-ReadGRIB
============

*****************************************************

THIS IS A TEST VERSION WITH NEW SUPPORT CMS GRIBS 

THERE ARE MANY CHANGES AND FULL TESTING HAS NOT BEEN DONE

USE V0.98 FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT TESTING

******************************************************


Geo::ReadGRIB is an object Perl module that provides read access to data 
distributed in GRIB files. Specifically, I wrote it to access NOAA Wavewatch 
III marine weather model forecasts which are packaged as GRIB. 

wgrib.c

Geo::ReadGRIB uses the C program wgrib to retrieve the GRIB file catalog and 
to extract the data. wgrib.c is included in the distribution and will compile 
when you make the module. The resulting executable is named wgrib.exe and 
should install in the same location as ReadGRIB.pm. ReadGRIB.pm will search 
for wgrib.exe at run time and die if it can't find it.

wgrib.c is known to compile and install correctly with Geo::ReadGRIB on FreeBSD, 
LINUX and Windows. In all cases the compiler was gcc and on Windows ActivePerl 
and nmake were used and the CC=gcc option was used with Makefile.PL

I've also been able to compile wgrib.c with gcc on Solaris Sparc and i386.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
